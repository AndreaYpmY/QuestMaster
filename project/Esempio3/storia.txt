Section 1: [INITIAL STATE - Dusty Bill arrives in Redstone Gulch]
Narrative:
The sun blazes down on the dusty streets of Redstone Gulch as Dusty Bill rides in on his weary horse. The town looks rough and worn—windows shuttered, faces wary, and a palpable tension hanging in the air. Sheriff Frank Mallory’s iron grip is evident; his deputies lurk near the saloon, which is overrun by a rough gang known for their lawlessness. The bank’s windows are boarded up hastily after a recent outlaw siege. Bill dismounts, feeling the weight of his past and the heavy burden of this town’s future.

A miner scrapes nearby, nodding briefly but not trusting enough to speak. Settlers eye Bill with suspicion, while a few shadowy figures linger in the alleyways—the Reformist Outlaws, a faction that claims to want peace but keeps their own secrets. Bill knows the path ahead: remove Frank Mallory, gain the trust of at least two factions, retrieve the compromising documents from the town hall, and face the final duel.

The gang is skeptical but hints at a possible alliance if Bill can prove his strength and integrity.
