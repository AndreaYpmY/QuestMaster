Lore Document – "The Shadow of the Dragon"

Quest Description: In the lands of Eldoria, an ancient dragon named Vharax has returned after centuries of slumber, spreading destruction across nearby villages. The kingdom, now in decline, no longer has an army strong enough to face him. Only a lone hero – the player – can embark on a perilous adventure to retrieve the **Spear of Light**, the only weapon capable of harming the dragon, which is kept in the ruins of the Temple of the Sun.
