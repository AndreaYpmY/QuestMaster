Section 1: [INITIAL STATE - Village of Ardent, player without powerful weapons]
Narrative:  
You stand in the bustling village square of Ardent, the last beacon of safety before the wild lands spread out across Eldoria. The air is thick with whispers of fear and hope — the dreaded dragon Vharax has awoken from his ancient slumber, leaving devastation in his wake. Villagers hurry past, clutching belongings and exchanging worried glances. In the corner, an old sage leans on his staff, his eyes gleaming with cryptic knowledge. You carry only your common sword and a pouch of coins, feeling the weight of destiny on your shoulders. The Spear of Light, your only hope against Vharax, lies hidden deep within the sealed Temple of the Sun, but the temple is locked tight, only accessible through a key rumored to be in the nearby Whispering Forest. Allies are scarce, and dangers lurk in every shadow.

The Whispering Forest holds the ancient key, but beware—the forest deceives with whispers of truth and lies. You may find allies there, or enemies disguised as friends. Remember, not all who offer help are trustworthy. Seek the forest mage rumored to dwell within, and heed the words of the trees.” He hands you a faded map, marked with cryptic symbols.
