Section 1: [INITIAL STATE - Theseus Leontos begins his quest at the Temple of Athena in Valyria]
Narrative:
Dawn breaks over the ancient Temple of Athena Phrónesis, perched atop the cliffs overlooking the sea. Theseus Leontos, the Heir of Light, stands before the goddess's statue, the air heavy with divine expectation. Athena’s voice echoes in his mind: “Theseus, the cosmic balance falters. The Titan Cronos stirs in the Rift of Ner'Adûn. You must recover the Five Gifts of Helios scattered across Valyria. Only then can you face the Four Champions of Cronos and seal the Rift. Your path will be perilous, shadowed by trials of flesh and spirit.”

Jason Argeïou, Theseus’s steadfast ally, approaches with a map. Cassandra of the Twin Oracle’s prophecies are still fresh in Theseus’s thoughts — warnings of sacrifice and the relentless march of time. The first step awaits: the forests where Periphetes the Clubman blocks the path, a giant with a bronze club guarding the Gift of Strength.
